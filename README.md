# 🏀➕📊 NBA Shot Charts: [WebApp](https://bensellnow-nba-shot-charts-welcome-3gzoaf.streamlit.app/)

This website is dedicated to providing NBA fans with shot charts for many players in NBA history. Shot charts are visualizations that show where a player has taken their shots from on the court, and how successful they were from each location.

To create these shot charts, the open-source project [nba-shotcharts](https://github.com/hkair/nba-shotcharts) was used as a starting point. This project provides an API (nba_api) that allows fetching shot data for any player in NBA history (from 1996-97 and onward), and then plot that data on a court diagram using the Python library `matplotlib`.

The Streamlit app was created to make it easy for NBA fans to explore these shot charts. Simply select a player from the dropdown menu, and the app will fetch their shot data and display their shot chart on the screen. You can then use the controls to filter the shot data by season type (Regular Season or Playoffs) and it will display the statistics accordingly.

Thank you for visiting NBA Shot Charts, and I hope you enjoy exploring the shooting history of your favorite NBA players!
